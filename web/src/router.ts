// The shell lives on a single path and branches on the `p`/`lang` query
// params (matching the original's `/?p=<page>&lang=<lang>` scheme exactly, so
// external links/bookmarks keep working) - see Shell.vue for the branching.
// play/ui keeps its own separate `/play/ui/?p=<code>` prefix the same way.
// play/ui is lazy (unlike Shell) because it pulls in @vue/repl for the live
// editor - a ~1.6MB dependency that would otherwise bloat every page's
// initial bundle, including ones with nothing to do with play/ui.
